# Sales-Data-analysis-Power-Bi-Report-and-Dashboard

## Problem Statement

AdventureWorks Cycles, a fictional manufacturing company, faces challenges in effectively tracking key performance indicators (KPIs), understanding regional sales performance, analyzing product-level trends, and identifying high-value customers. The companyâ€™s raw data lacks organization and actionable insights, making it difficult for decision-makers to understand business trends and optimize operations.

The objective of this project is to transform the raw data into meaningful, professional-quality reports and dashboards. These tools will enable AdventureWorks Cycles to monitor performance across regions, evaluate product sales, and identify customer segments that drive the most value. This project follows a structured business intelligence workflow, including data preparation, modeling, analysis, and visualization, to deliver actionable insights for better decision-making.


### Steps followed 

STAGE 1: Connecting & Shaping Data

In this stage, the focus was on developing automated workflows to extract, clean, transform, and load project data using Power Query. We explored various data connectors, storage modes, profiling tools, and performed table transformations, among other tasks.

* Data connectors

* Storage & import modes

* Query editing tools

* Table transformations

* Connecting to a database

* Extracting data from the web

* QA & Profiling tools

* Text, numerical, date & time tools

* Rolling calendars

* Index & conditional columns

* Grouping & aggregating

* Pivoting & unpivoting

* Merging & appending queries

* Data source parameters

* Importing Excel models

STAGE 2: Creating a Relational Data Model

In stage 2, we reviewed best practices for data modeling, covered topics such as cardinality, normalization, filter flow, and star schemas, and started building the AdventureWorks data model from scratch.

* Database normalization

* Fact & dimension tables

* Primary & foreign keys

* Star & snowflake schemas

* Active & inactive relationships

* Relationship cardinality

* Filter context & flow

* Bi-directional filters

* Model layouts

* Data formats & categories

* Hierarchies

STAGE 3: Adding Calculated Fields with DAX

In stage 3, we introduced Data Analysis Expressions (DAX), created calculated columns and measures, and explored concepts such as row and filter context. We also practiced using powerful tools like filter functions, iterators, and time intelligence patterns.

* DAX vs. M

* Calculated columns & measures

* Implicit, explicit & quick measures

* Measure calculation steps

* DAX syntax & operators

* Math & stats functions

* Conditional & logical functions

* The SWITCH function

* Text functions

* Date & time functions

* The RELATED function

* CALCULATE, FILTER & ALL

* Iterator (X) functions

* Time intelligence patterns

STAGE 4: Visualizing Data with Reports

Stage 4 focused on bringing the data to life through reports and dashboards. We reviewed best practices for data visualization, built and formatted basic charts, and enhanced interactivity using bookmarks, slicer panels, parameters, tooltips, report navigation, and more.

* Dashboard design framework

* Cards & KPIs

* Line charts, trend lines & forecasts

* On-object formatting

* Table & matrix visuals

* Conditional formatting

* Top N filtering

* Map visuals

* Drill up, drill down & drillthrough

* Report slicers & interactions

* Bookmarks & page navigation

* Numeric & fields parameters

* Custom tooltips

* Importing custom visuals

* Managing & viewing roles (RLS)
